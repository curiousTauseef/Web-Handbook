<h1 class="title">Welcome</h1>

Welcome to the Sosolimited Web Handbook. The web handbook is a collection of resources on Javascript and web development, starting with web fundamentals in HTML + CSS and diving deeper into topics like databases, servers, paper.js, and D3. 

This material was originally prepared by Sosolimited for our 2015 Code Camp, a week-long programming workshop held in July of 2015. It combines our own lessons with articles, tutorials, code samples, and tools available on the web. Follow the lessons in sequence or refer to specific links when you need a refresher.
