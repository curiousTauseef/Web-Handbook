Your Browser is your IDE
========================

You can set up your browser to help you work more iteratively when doing web development.
Read about setting up [Workspaces in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/workspaces). Similar facilities are available in all major browsers.

Also, I made a little javascript [chalkboard](http://sansumbrella.github.io/BCS/chalkboard/) for working out ideas and explaining concepts.
